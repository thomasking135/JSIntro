# Javascript Introduction

Welcome to Javascript! This challenge is made up of lots of small little exercises. If you get stuck on any one, just move on and come back to it later or ask for help.

## Setup

In your terminal run the following commands to launch the application

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This should open up a web browser which will give you feedback as you progress. Every time you complete an exercise the web page should automatically update with feedback on your progress (i.e. from red to green). 

Work through the files in `src/challenges` - you can ignore the rest of the code, it's just how we update the page with the feedback.
